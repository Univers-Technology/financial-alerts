# Financial Alerts Project

This project is designed for you to utilize one of three well-established web
frameworks: FastAPI, Django, or Flask. Select the framework you are most familiar with
or prefer to use for completing the assignment.

## Available Frameworks
- **FastAPI**: Ideal for building high-performance APIs with Python 3.7+ based on
standard Python type hints.
- **Django**: Suitable for developers looking for a high-level Python Web framework that
facilitates rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Flask**: A lightweight and flexible Python micro-framework for those who prefer a
minimalistic approach.

## Project Setup
You will find a basic setup for each framework within its respective directory in this
repository. The `transactions.json` file, which you may find useful for this assignment,
is located in the project root.

## Assignment Overview
Your task is to develop a Financial Alerts feature using the `transactions.json`.
Detailed instructions and specific requirements are available in the project spec that
you received in your email, and there are also README files located in each framework's
directory with some instructions on how to get up and running with your chosen
framework.

## Steps to Proceed
1. Select the framework you are most comfortable with.
2. Navigate to the corresponding framework's directory and review the README for
detailed instructions.
3. Configure your development environment as recommended for your selected framework.
4. Implement the required features using the `transactions.json` as described in the
framework-specific README.

The provided code in each framework's directory is primarily for initial setup. You are
expected to integrate the `transactions.json` and build the necessary business logic as
outlined in the project requirements document.

We encourage you to leverage your familiarity with your chosen framework to efficiently
complete this project.

Good luck, and we look forward to your implementation!
